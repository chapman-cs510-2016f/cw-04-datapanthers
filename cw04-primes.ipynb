    "It is an ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. We start by producing a list of all the numbers lower than the given value starting at 2 in a list, then we traverse through the list one at a time, removing any number if it is divisible by another number within the list. We are then left with only prime numbers remaining in our list, lower than our given value. "

    "The second function uese a generator function. The generator can run infinitely and we only need to call it as many times as we need. It is also easy to edit and find errors as the work is split in two different functions, and is also easy for readers as each function has a specific task to perform. \n",

Whereas a tuple, for example, would be more permanent and we would be unable to remove numbers from it. We also did not used a dictonary as we felt the list would store exacly what we needed and a dictionary also has keys for it's variables, which we decided was unnecessary for this particular module.\n",
